  \section{Motivation and introduction}
  \label{sec:motivation}

  In software engineering, often \ac{mde} is used to increase development productivity and quality. \cite{transformations-modeldriven} Concepts are modeled closer to the domain, so that they describe important aspects of a solution with human-friendly abstractions. The models can also be used to generate application fragments, that can be directly used as a template source code. In the process of \ac{mde}, many activities need to transform source models into different target models, while following a set of transformation rules. This model transformation process is based on algebraic graph transformations. A metamodel is used to model the structure and rules of the concept. The resulting transformation language can provide automatic model creation, development, and maintenance activities. \cite{transformations-modeldriven} One framework to use \ac{mde} is \ac{emf} by the Eclipse Foundation. It provides a basis for application development, using modeling and code generation facilities. Many frameworks build upon \ac{emf}, providing various \ac{mde} tools like code generators, graphical diagramming, model transformation, or model validation. \cite{emf} One model transformation framework is Henshin. \cite{henshin-repo} It tries to provide model transformation capabilities with a high level of usability. \cite{henshin-usability} For metamodels it uses \ac{emf} Ecore files and for instance models \ac{emf} XMI files. The framework enables transformations on XMI instance files with a defined transformation language. It provides a graphical and textual syntax to create these transformation rules. \cite{henshin-repo} Henshin can be used as a Eclipse plugin. Eclipse makes it easy to access, but especially for new users, the heavy editor makes the use of Henshin unintuitive.
  Therefore, the goal exists to create a graphical option to use the Henshin model transformations without the overhead of the heavy Eclipse editor. A web-based graphical editor would make the use of Henshin even more accessible and intuitive.

  \ac{glsp} is a open-source framework by the Eclipse Foundation, which can be used to build a web-based Henshin graph editor. The framework is used to develop custom diagram editors for distributed web-applications. \cite{glsp-repo} It can provide graph editors for the Eclipse Desktop IDE, Eclipse Theia, \ac{vscode} and a standalone version usable in any website. It brings the support of \ac{emf} models as a data source and the Henshin SDK can be used from the Java server of \ac{glsp}. \cite{glsp-doc} With these functionalities, \ac{glsp} fits to create an easy accessible, intuitive application to create and apply Henshin model transformations, called Henshin Web.


  The goal of this scientific work is to provide relevant information about the used technologies. Also existing web-based model transformation tools will be compared in the related work section. In section \ref{sec:deployment}, the deployment and usage of the Henshin Web editor will be discussed. The goal is to provide a web-based editor that can be used without any dependencies, like an installed \ac{ide} or other tools. The editor should be easy to access and use, so that it can be used by new users without any prior knowledge of model transformations or Henshin.

  \section{Related Work}
  \label{sec:related-work}

  There are many existing tools for model transformations. \citeauthor{kahani2019survey} created a survey in \citeyear{kahani2019survey} of various model transformation tools. They classified 60 different tools, including Henshin. In Figure \ref{fig:tools-environments}, you can see how many tools provide specific execution environments. 73\% of the tools provide plugins for the Eclipse \ac{ide}, and 20\% of the tools are integrated or dependent on other \acsp{ide}. 18\% have no \ac{ide} support, and only two tools are web-based. In total, 89\% of the tools have external dependencies such as an \ac{ide} or other tools. Dependencies often complicate the installation and usage of the tool. \cite{kahani2019survey}

  \begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Execution environments of model transformation tools. Image obtained from \cite{kahani2019survey}}
    \label{fig:tools-environments}
  \end{figure}

  One web-based tool included in the survey is \ac{atompm} \cite{atompm}. It is a web-based modeling tool to create \ac{dsml} environments, performing model transformations and manipulating and managing models. \cite{atompm} It was created in \citeyear{atompm} and supports all model transformations that are based on T-Core \cite{tcore}, a minimal common basis that allows interoperability between different model transformation languages. \cite{tcore} Metamodels can be defined with a simplified \ac{uml} language. The graphical modeling environment offers debugging and the ability to collaborate and share modeling artifacts in the browser. \cite{atompm}


  There are also other web-based tools for \ac{mde}. WebGME \cite{webGME} is a web-based modeling tool, created in \citeyear{webGME}. It allows to collaboratively design \acp{dsml} using model versioning and broadcasting changes to all active users. It supports prototypical inheritance, where any model can be instantiated recursively, so changes are propagated down the inheritance tree. It also provides scalability, collaborative modeling and model versioning. Metamodels and compositions can be created with WebGME, but no graph transformations can be applied to a model. Even though model transformations are not possible, the editor was one of  the first solutions for web-based modeling tools. \cite{webGME} The software provides extension points to customize or extend the software, but no model transformation capabilities were added by any available extension. \cite{webgme-website} The tool is still hosted and maintained, to be used for free. \cite{webgme-website}


  WebDPF \cite{webDPF} is another web-based modeling tool, published in \citeyear{webDPF}. Compared to WebGME and \ac{atompm}, it supports model navigation and element filter capabilities, a JavaScript editor for writing predicate semantics, reusability of transformation rules, partial model completion, and a termination analysis. These features try to improve the usability of the tool. \cite{webDPF} Even though the tool had improvments upon existing tools, the originally mentioned hosted WebDPF portal is offline by now. 


  There is also a \ac{glsp}-based Ecore metamodel editor, created by the \ac{glsp} development team. It was implemented with the \ac{glsp} version 0.9 but never updated further. It allows to create and edit \ac{emf} Ecore models in a Theia web editor. Even though the project cannot be used directly, due to the use of another source model format and breaking changes in major updates of the \ac{glsp} framework, it provides various classes that can be used as a template for the Henshin Web Ecore viewer. One example is the factory code that maps the \ac{emf} Ecore model to the graphical model. \cite{glsp-ecore-repo}
  The findings show, that there are many existing model transformation tools, but only very few web-based solutions, that provide an easy entry into \ac{mde} and model transformations. Henshin web tries to fill this gap.

  \section{Deployment and Usage}
  \label{sec:deployment}

  A \ac{glsp} editor can be deployed and used in production in various ways. \ac{glsp} provides platform integrations for the Eclipse Desktop IDE, Eclipse Theia, \ac{vscode}, and as a standalone web application. Each integration brings different integration possibilities, deployment, and usage options for the editor. \cite{glsp-doc} The main considerations for the deployment and usage are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The user should need as few dependencies as possible. Dependencies are a browser runtime, an \ac{ide} to install, or an extension to install.
    \item The app should be easy to access. Possible barriers are the creation of an account or the installation of dependencies.
    \item Using a self-hosted server or a cloud service. With a self-hosted server, the user has full access of local files to open and edit. With a cloud service, the user has to upload and download files to the server.
  \end{itemize}
  
  To use \ac{glsp} as a standalone web application, a dependency injection container with the custom \ac{glsp} client is added to a TypeScript browser application. Like that the editor of a certain file as a data source can be displayed. When the app is hosted, no other dependency than a browser runtime is needed to use the standalone diagram editor. \cite{glsp-client-repo} This option provides the most flexibility, as it can be used in any web application, but also requires the most effort to implement, when developing a complete editor. All features, like file management, window management, or other features a \ac{ide} brings, need to be implemented by the developer. \cite{glsp-client-repo} For our use case, the standalone web application is not an option, as these additional features are needed. 

  The other \ac{glsp} integrations are \ac{ide} integrations and therefore provide many features out of the box. For the Eclipse \ac{ide} integration, Eclipse has to be installed, and the \ac{glsp} plugin has to be added to the Eclipse installation. The plugin can be installed from the Eclipse Marketplace or manually by downloading the plugin jar file. \cite{eclipse-doc} The \ac{vscode} integration also provides this option. The \ac{ide} can be installed and the \ac{glsp} editor can be added as an extension. The extension can be installed from the Marketplace or manually using a \textit{.vsix} file. \cite{vscode-doc} The \ac{glsp} \ac{vscode} integration can provide a \textit{.vsix} file. \cite{glsp-repo} \ac{vscode} is the most used \ac{ide}. 73.6\% of developers use \ac{vscode} due to the survey of \citeauthor{stackoverflow2024survey} In \citeyear{stackoverflow2024survey} \cite{stackoverflow2024survey}. An advantage to Eclipse is that \ac{vscode} provides a browser version, which brings the same capabilities as the desktop \ac{ide}. \cite{vscode-doc} So this integration provides the advantage that no \ac{ide} has to be installed to be able to use Henshin Web. The user can open \ac{vscode}, add the extension, and directly open a metamodel, rule, or instance model file and start editing. 

  The Eclipse Theia \ac{ide} is not as widely popular as \ac{vscode} \cite{stackoverflow2024survey}, but its focus is not to provide a ready \ac{ide} but to provide tools to create custom \acsp{ide}. The Eclipse Theia project is part of the Eclipse Foundation and is used as a basis to create your own \acsp{ide} based on web technologies. \cite{theia-doc} They provide the Theia IDE that acts as a template editor and can be downloaded and used on all common operating systems or used in as a web editor in the browser. Due to the focus on providing a framework to build custom \acsp{ide}, Theia provides more options to use extensions and plugins to extend the functionality. You can see the options and their architectural integration into Theia in figure \ref{fig:theia-extensions}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\ac{vscode} extensions} Theia provides the \ac{vscode} extension \ac{api}, so that existing \ac{vscode} extensions can be used in Theia. They only interact with the \ac{api} and therefore can be installed at runtime.
    \item \textbf{Theia plugins} are working like \ac{vscode} extensions. They interact with the Theia plugin \ac{api} and can also access the \ac{vscode} extension \ac{api}. They can access some Theia specific features, that \ac{vscode} extensions cannot access, like directly contributing to the frontend. They can also be installed at runtime, or be pre-installed at compile time.
    \item \textbf{Headless plugins} are also working like \ac{vscode} extensions. They can also be installed at runtime and can access custom extended Theia backend services.
    \item \textbf{Theia extensions} are the core architecture parts of Theia. Theia is fully built using Theia extensions in a modular way. The template Theia \ac{ide} contains Theia extensions, including the core. Custom Theia extensions can be developed and added to Theia with full access to all Theia functionality via dependency injection. They need to be installed at compile time. \cite{theia-doc}
  \end{itemize}

  The \ac{glsp} Theia integration is creating a Theia extension, that is packed into a custom Theia \ac{ide}. It is also possible to use the \ac{glsp} \ac{vscode} integration that provides a \ac{vscode} extension, that can also be added to a Theia \ac{ide} at runtime. \cite{glsp-repo} The option to use the diagram editor in the browser makes the \ac{glsp} Eclipse integration not interesting for Henshin Web. \ac{vscode} has the advantage of popularity and simplicity to use the editor without any registration or installation. Eclipse Theia has the advantage of modularity and further extensibility. Further features can be added in the future to provide a web-based environment for \ac{mde}. Theia also provides different ways to deploy a Theia \ac{ide}.   These considerations show that the Theia integration is the best option for deploying the Henshin Web editor. Theia combines the advantages of browser-based access, modularity, and extensibility.

    \label{fig:theia-extensions}
  \end{figure}

  There are different options to provide a \ac{glsp} Theia application. The Theia editor, consisting of the TypeScript client and the Java server, can be hosted in the cloud and accessed via a web browser. The Eclipse Foundation provides the Theia Cloud project \cite{theia-cloud-doc} to deploy Theia based products on Kubernetes clusters \cite{kubernetes}. Theia Cloud introduces three custom Kubernetes resource types. \textit{App Definitions} contain all necessary information about the Theia based product. \textit{Workspaces} define persistent storage solutions, where metamodel, rule, or instance model files can be stored for each user. \textit{Sessions} are acting as a runtime representaions. Theia Cloud includes components like a landing page, authentication, authorization, a cloud monitor, and a cloud operator, that deploys sessions and manages workspaces. You can see the different components and their interactions in figure \ref{fig:theia-cloud-components}. The service provides two preconfigured configurations for quickly trying out Theia Cloud on a cluster. \cite{theia-cloud-doc}

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{theia-cloud-components.png}
    \caption{Interaction between Theia Cloud components. Image obtained from \cite{theia-cloud-doc}}
    \label{fig:theia-cloud-components}
  \end{figure}

  Because of the limited file access of the browser, the user has to upload and download all files to the server to use them. To be able to access the local file system of the user directly, the server needs to be hosted locally. For that, \ac{glsp} Theia application can be hosted in a Docker container. \cite{docker} The Docker container can contain the Java server and the TypeScript client, that are started together. The user can then access the editor via a web browser. On a machine with a Docker environment, this solution can be started locally in an easy way and has the access to the file system. The Docker container can also be used to deploy the application on a server so that it can be accessed by multiple users. The single Docker container solution doesn't provide as much scalability as using a cluster with Theia Cloud.

  The \ac{glsp} Theia application can also be used as a desktop application. Theia uses Electron \cite{electron-repo} to bundle the application into a desktop application, that can be installed via an installer. This approach also provides access to the local file system, since the electron application works like a self-hosted web application, and therefore the \ac{glsp} Java server is started locally. All in all, the \ac{glsp} Theia integration provides all different options to use the Henshin Web editor. Further clients can always be added later if needed.

  \section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  This scientific work motivated the development of a web-based model transformation graph editor and introduced all the important frameworks needed for the planned project. \ac{glsp} is a fitting framework to create a web-based diagram editor, that already provides solutions for \ac{emf} source models. That makes the integration of the Henshin \ac{sdk} easier, as it is also based on \ac{emf}. \ac{glsp} also provides many features out of the box, that are needed for an intuitive diagram editor, like file or window management.
  The related work showed, that many model transformation tools rely on \acsp{ide} or other dependencies. There are not many web-based model transformation tools, that can be easily used. The advantage of Eclipse Theia, that provides a complete \ac{ide} in the browser, removes the issue of a complicated installation process and provides an easy to use editor.
  The deployment and usage section showed all options that \ac{glsp} provides. The Theia integration provides a modular, extensible and web-based solution to use for the Henshin Web editor. There are three main options to provide the editor to the users. It can be packaged as a desktop application, including an installer. The \ac{glsp} client and server can be hosted in a Docker container, that can be used to run locally or host in the cloud. The third option is to use Theia Cloud, that simplifies the deployment of Theia based products and provides easy to use features like user workspaces, authentication, and authorization.
