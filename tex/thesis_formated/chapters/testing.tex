  \section{Testing Strategy}
  \label{subsec:testing-strategy}

  For the Java backend, unit tests wer implemented using JUnit. For every milestone of the development process, unit tests were added to ensure the added functionality works as expected. The tests cover the core functionality of the backend. Mocking was used to simulate the behaviour of some components, like the \code{ModelState}.

  To test the UI, automated UI tests were created using Playwright.
